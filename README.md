# Introduction 
Car Configurator was a learning project as an introduction to asp.net. I used ASP.NET MVC for the backend, Vuejs for client side, SQL Server for the database and bootstrap and less for a simple UI. The website is build with responsive design using the built-in bootstrap classes.

This is a fork based on the carConfigurator repository. The difference to the original repo is the use of Vuejs for building a single page application. In addition to the technologies above, I used webpack for bundling and minification.
I also used Vuex and Vue Router, as well as Vue-i18next for localization.
